1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:06,379
way went to a self

2
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:08,349
defense class . Yeah ,

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,220
Kicking a guy in the

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,529
crotch all morning really takes

5
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:10,960
it out of you .

6
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:13,619
Takes it out of you

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,320
. Now we can kick

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,949
anybody's ass after one class

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,019
. I don't think so

10
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:22,210
. What ? You want

11
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,019
to see me self defend

12
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:24,359
myself ? Go over there

13
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,750
and pretend you're sexual predator

14
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:26,559
. Go on . In

15
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:29,649
the area . Off course

16
00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:30,649
, you could defend yourself

17
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:31,949
from an attack you know

18
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,479
is coming . That's not

19
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:35,450
enough . Look , I

20
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,740
studied karate for a long

21
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,969
, and there's a concept

22
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:42,570
you should really be familiar

23
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,240
with . It's what the

24
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,109
Japanese call who not G

25
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:49,670
is not a kind of

26
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,469
sushi . No , it's

27
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,700
a concept . It is

28
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,140
. It is . It's

29
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,250
freshwater healed . But maybe

30
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,259
it means that too .

31
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,149
Oh , I would kill

32
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:00,079
for a salmon skin roll

33
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,479
right now . Fine .

34
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:03,829
Get attacked . Only care

35
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:07,099
. Come on , Ross

36
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:07,189
, we're sorry . Please

37
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:08,200
tell us what it is

38
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,420
. Maggie is a state

39
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,790
of total awareness . Okay

40
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,420
? On Lee . By

41
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,400
achieving true Nagy , can

42
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,510
you be prepared for any

43
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,400
danger that may befall you

44
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,140
? You mean in case

45
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:26,450
someone's trying to steal your

46
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:27,629
bamboo sleeping matter ? Your

47
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:34,269
kettle of fish ? A

48
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:34,140
. What I'm saying is

49
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,739
it's one thing being prepared

50
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:37,730
for an attack against ,

51
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,900
like each other , a

52
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:40,689
whole another story being prepared

53
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,640
for an attack by surprise

54
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,120
. All right ? You

55
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,260
knew that was coming .

56
00:01:53,269 --> 00:01:53,480
But that doesn't mean you

57
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,969
have you , Nagi .

58
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,849
Oh , you know what

59
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:00,840
? If we made reservations

60
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,319
, we could have a

61
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,609
nagging about 1/2 hour .

62
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,349
What's that ? A lesson

63
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,530
in the importance of unagi

64
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,150
. You're a freak .

65
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:30,770
Perhaps . Now I'm curious

66
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:30,840
. At what point during

67
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,780
those girlish screams , would

68
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,810
you have begun to kick

69
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,219
my ass ? All right

70
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:40,110
, so we weren't prepared

71
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,490
. I'm sorry . I

72
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,949
had to take such drastic

73
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:46,430
measures to make my point

74
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:46,050
, But I look ,

75
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:46,879
I just want you guys

76
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:58,129
to be safe . Uh

77
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:12,650
, not G seven skin

78
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,460
roll . Jack . Yeah

79
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,120

00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:21,310
, of course . Chuck

81
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,319
Woolery . Definitely . Phoebe

82
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:23,509
, you will not find

83
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:25,699
a single game show host

84
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,599
whose ass I cannot kick

85
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:38,639
. No , say it

86
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:39,250
. Say we are Nagy

87
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:42,810
. It's not something .

88
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,500
You are something you have

89
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:46,409
. Say it . You

90
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:47,740
know , I usually get

91
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,280
out of this , but

92
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,580
there's a chance you could

93
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,719
get very , very hurt

94
00:03:54,169 --> 00:04:02,569
. No . Uh huh

95
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,050
. Nowhere to run .

96
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,449
I don't like sitting up

97
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:12,069
